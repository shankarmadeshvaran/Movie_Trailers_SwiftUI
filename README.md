# Movie_Trailers_SwiftUI
This is a basic app that I have created to shows the latest movies trailers based on different genres using SwiftUI.I have also integrated UIKit viewcontroller and views into SwiftUI project using UIViewControllerRepresentable and UIViewRepresentable.

This project was made for fun to try out Swift UI and see how it interacts with other layers of the application now that we don't have view controllers. We're all still learning. This project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the ideas put accross in WWDC videos and in the documentation.

## Concepts
In this Project I have used SwiftUI's basic concepts and views and also integrated UIKit's page Controller by using UIViewRepresentable and UIViewControllerRepresentable.

## Platforms
Task app will currently run from iOS 13+.
This app is updated for Xcode 11+ . I'll be updating the code for upcoming updates also.

## Implementation
I have put an detailed article on [Building Movie Trailer App Using SwiftUI](https://medium.com/@shankarmadeshvaran/building-movie-trailer-app-using-swiftui-5d4dc5497462) in Medium.
